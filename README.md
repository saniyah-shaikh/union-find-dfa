# union-find-dfa

Implemented the union find data structure, and used it to check the state equivilance of two states in a Determininistic Finite State Automaton. The program reads in the pairs of states to check from Query.txt, reads in the DFA from DFA.txt, then runs and prints all the partitions that it has gone throught to Partitions.txt, and the validity of each query to Test.txt.
